# "Ven a Crecer"

"Ven a Crecer" (which translates to "come to learn") is [Code For Venezuela][C4V]'s project to bring [MIT's ReACT][ReACT] to the Venezuelan diaspora. It's developed with BerserkTech core members, see [/AUTHORS](/AUTHORS) for the full list of people involved, and [our project tracker][GHP] to follow our progress.

The decades of ongoing human rights violations in Venezuela have made the life of millions insufferable. The affected population has been having an ongoing exodus, making them refugees as much as those who have been unwillingly moved out of their homes due to other extreme situations, such as wars and famine. These events have been leaving many capable students and professionals, with their families included, in unfavorable situations. Unable to continue their education, or lacking the acknowledgement of the industries local to the location they unwillingly moved to, they struggle, many times having to forfeit their careers.

### About BerserkTech

BerserkTech is a community of Venezuelans with high technical qualifications. They consider themselves `We’re relentless, we’re passionate and we do care, deeply, for each other`. They're brought together by three principles:

- `A club, not a job`, through which they consider this community `a place in the internet where we get to be together, to share ideas and experiences and possibly to develop alliances for any kind of endeavors`.
- `Battle Royale`, where they propose that membership requires effort, arguing that `membership has the inherent value of scarcity, but also that we have an excuse to remain active`.
- Community as an advertisement platform, through which they argue that `The progress of each individual will make this list more valuable for the rest of us`.

This community is primarily driven by their accounts on GitHub, Keybase and Telegram. You can read more about this community on the following links:

### About MIT's ReACT

According to [their website][ReACT]:

> The MIT ReACT Certificate Program is part of the MIT ReACT Hub, an initiative that was launched in May 2017 when the challenge of refugee education was presented at MIT SOLVE. Professor Admir Masic and now Vice Chancellor Ian Waitz championed the creation of a center at MIT to design and deploy new learning opportunities for displaced populations around the world. Driven by his own experience as a refugee, Prof. Masic has inspired a collection of related projects to come together as a community to address this growing crisis. Their initiative was quickly supported by the leadership of Hala Fadel, Thomas Ermacora, and Riccardo Sabatini. The MIT Enterprise Forum Pan-Arab Region is ReACT’s inaugural Seed Partner and serves as its logistics support.

### The Venezuelan Diaspora

As stated in Wikipedia:

> Following the Bolivarian Revolution, many Venezuelans have sought residence in other countries. According to Newsweek, the "Bolivarian diaspora is a reversal of fortune on a massive scale" where the reversal is a comparison to when in the 20th century, "Venezuela was a haven for immigrants fleeing Old World repression and intolerance".[15] El Universal explains how the "Bolivarian diaspora" in Venezuela has been caused by the "deterioration of both the economy and the social fabric, rampant crime, uncertainty and lack of hope for a change in leadership in the near future".

- `According to Iván de la Vega, the number of Venezuelans living abroad increased by over 2,000 percent from the mid-1990s to 2013 (from 50,000 to 1,200,000). The median emigrant age is 32.` (2015) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_diaspora), [source](https://www.buzzfeed.com/karlazabludovsky/the-brain-drain-from-venezuela).

### Ven a Crecer's Proposal

"Ven a Crecer" is the codename for Code For Venezuela's effort to bring MIT's ReACT program to the Venezuelan Diaspora. Is mainly coordinated by BerserkTech team members.

## Roadmap

"Ven a Crecer" is an ongoing effort. Here's a sketch of the roadmap:

- May, 2019: Establish communications with the MIT.
- July, 2019: Have concrete documentation and communication channels with existing organizations working on aid to the Venezuelans refugee crisis.
- Late 2019: Have a concise plan to bring MIT's ReACT program to Venezuelans.
- Late 2019-Early 2020: MIT's ReACT program for Venezuelans should have started on a minimal control group.
- Mid 2020: MIT's ReACT program for the Venezuelan Diaspora would start to reach refugees in Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Spain.

## Ongoing Results

"Ven a Crecer" is an ongoing effort. Here's a list of links related to current existing achievements:

## How to Contribute

## Glossary of Terms

### Refugee

According to [The UN Refugee Agency][UNHCR]:

> A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war or violence. A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so. War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries.

### Asylum Seekers

According to [The UN Refugee Agency][UNHCR]:

> When people flee their own country and seek sanctuary in another country, they apply for asylum – the right to be recognized as a refugee and receive legal protection and material assistance. An asylum seeker must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution in his or her home country is well-founded.
[Source][UNHCRFacts]

### 1951 Refugee Convention

According to [The UN Refugee Agency][UNHCR]:

> The 1951 Geneva Convention is the main international instrument of refugee law. The Convention clearly spells out who a refugee is and the kind of legal protection, other assistance and social rights he or she should receive from the countries who have signed the document. The Convention also defines a refugee’s obligations to host governments and certain categories or people, such as war criminals, who do not qualify for refugee status. The Convention was limited to protecting mainly European refugees in the aftermath of World War II, but another document, the 1967 Protocol, expanded the scope of the Convention as the problem of displacement spread around the world.
