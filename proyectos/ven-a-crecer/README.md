# "Ven a Crecer"

"Ven a Crecer" (which translates to "come to learn") is [Code For Venezuela][C4V]'s project to bring [MIT's ReACT][ReACT] to the Venezuelan diaspora. It's developed with BerserkTech core members, see [/AUTHORS](/AUTHORS) for the full list of people involved, and [our project tracker](https://github.com/berserktech/ideas/projects/1) to follow our progress.

The decades of ongoing human rights violations in Venezuela have made the life of millions insufferable. The affected population has been having an ongoing exodus, making them refugees as much as those who have been unwillingly moved out of their homes due to other extreme situations, such as wars and famine. These events have been leaving many capable students and professionals, with their families included, in unfavorable situations. Unable to continue their education, or lacking the acknowledgement of the industries local to the location they unwillingly moved to, they struggle, many times having to forfeit their careers.
